    "# What's In A Name? Investigating Bias And Identity In Text-To-Image Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This work will investigate the relationships between names and biases in text to image models. some narrower topics of interest include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* constructing measures for characterizing the degree to which a model has learned the relationship between a name and specific entity\n",
    "* measuring biases associated with names that are not tightly bound to identities\n",
    "* characterizing how biases of these kinds can be composed into new identities\n",
    "* characterizing the \"stickiness\" of specific attribute biases to identities/names\n",
    "* investigating the potential for leveraging these measure to monitor training progress for personalization finetuning and general purpose pre-training\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* biases in names\n",
    "* known identities (\"strong entities\")\n",
    "* overfitted identities (memorized images)\n",
    "  * mona lisa?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Just investigating biases, not making normative statements\n",
    "\n",
    "* associated hypotheses\n",
    "* out of scope hypotheses (future work)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology [wip]\n",
    "\n",
    "* choosing names\n",
    "* generating images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "* calibrating minimum # images\n",
    "* investigating which embedding representation to use\n",
    "* experimenting with summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* presumptive phases of bias formation\n",
    "* correlation between age bias and popularity of names by birth year\n",
    "* strength of ethnic bias reflects undersampled data class\n",
    "  * strong biases hint at low data cardinality for the given class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
